Welcome and thank you for taking the time to complete our take-home challenge for our web developer position.

This assignment should take you around an hour to complete, but please don't go over 2 hours. 

Once you have completed your solution, please compress your app into a zip file and send it to us.

Deadline: Please submit your solution by Thursday, 08/19/2021.

The goal of this challenge is to build out a UI and layout found in this image: /examples/screenshot.png

The UI is made up of a main header title and a list of posts. 

You will need to make an API call to retrieve the posts. To get the posts, use this URL: https://dtcqvoap3l.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/default/interviewTakeHomeApi

A starting point component is created at: /src/Content/Content.js.

The aspects of your code we will assess include:
1) Correctness: does the application do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
2) Code quality: is the code simple, clean, readable, performant, and maintainable?

Here are the strict rules of this challenge...you must:
1) Follow directions found in README to get started.
1) Use the way you see fit to make the API call.
2) Create components as you feel is best suited for your solution.
3) Render the image, title, and description of each post in the list.

Optional: Feel free to utilize Bootstrap or any other similar framework.

Bonus Challenge: Lazy load the posts to the page. Each post should only be visible once it is in the viewport. See example: /example/lazy-loading.mov

The rest is up to you!

The example image and video are there as a demo. You have free rein to be creative with the UI once you have an initial solution.

If there are any comments or clarification that you want to add, please write it in the README
